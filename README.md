## Installation

Lagoon Logs relies on the wonderful [monolog library](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog),
as such, the library needs to be available at runtime.

Monolog is generally installed by composer, and one way of accomplishing this in Drupal 7 is to install the [Composer manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_manager) module.

* Install Composer Manager
* Enable Lagoon Logs
